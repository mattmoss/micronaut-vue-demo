Simple Micronaut Vue Demo


The server sub-project includes a Micronaut service for managing
Person instances in a relational database.

The ui sub-project includes a Vue front end which communicates
with the Micronaut service.

To run the services you will need to have JDK 8 or later
installed and configured.


Run the server:

./gradlew :server:run

After the server starts run the ui:

./gradlew :ui:run

After the ui starts up open a browser to send a request
to http://localhost:8081/ to access the UI.

The server is configured to use an in memory database so
the data will disappear when the process is terminated.


To build a standalone executable jar to serve up both
the ui and the REST api, execute the assemble task:

./gradlew assemble

Or to assemble and run tests, execute the build task:

./gradlew build


To run the standalone jar:

./gradlew runShadow

Or to run the standalone jar without gradle:

java -jar server/build/libs/server-0.1-all.jar
